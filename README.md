## Learn Effective Data Communication

*Three Principles of Effective Data Communication:*

1. Clear - Concise and uncluttered

2. Easy to Understand - Can see the point of the graphs

3. Tells a Story- Shows the data in a way the viewer can see and understand, in a meaningful way.

## Basics of Visual Perception

Order:
- The order in which items are perceived, for graphs this an be sporadic, so there needs to be care in building them.

Hierarchy:
- The eye tends to be drawn towards brighter colors, so you can highlight specific items in such a way that every element fits into part of a story, for instance adding a vertical line in a graph draws the attention to each side of the graph, so pay attention to how the line attracts attention, and make sure it fits in with the context of the story you want your data to tell.

Clarity:
- Emphasizing parts of your graphs or data, using highlights, etc.

Relationships:
- Humans tend to tell stories that relate things which are together on a graph. We like to form patterns and do so naturally. Presenting data together on a graph will naturally lead viewers to connect them in their heads, don't present false relationships.

Convention:
- General or agreed upon styling preferences in the industry.

Understanding these items can be used to highlight the important data you want to convey, and help you avoid conveying things you don't want to convey.

## Choose Appropriate Graphs for the Data

Comparison between values:
- Bar Chart, Our brains are good at quickly estimating comparative heights and what that means about values of longer or shorter bars.

Comparison to the Whole:
- Stacked Bar Chart this is good when you don't have segments that are too small, and you have a limited number of segments

Change over time:
- Line Chart good for sparse plots my preferred plot, the elements of continuity mean that inflection points stand out naturally.

Ranking data:
- Bar chart is the best you can use horizontal charts with the independent variable being the ranking, and then it's easy to see how various choices line up.

Correlation:
-Scatter plot almost all of the time, it shows the relationship of 2 variables

Geographical charts:
- A generally bad choice, but color pallets like warm_cool can be used to highlight numerical differences across boundaries.

Measuring a target: 
- A simple gauge, can look a bit like a thermometer, or a speed gauge, and those that are optimal measuring devices.

Showing Outliers: 
-A table is good for this you can color in certain cells to highlight the big outliers.

Understanding these lets you communicate effectively. If you're analysis is good but your presentation is unclear important points may not be communicated.

It is easy to lie with statistics. It is hard to tell the truth without it.

## Decluttering Visualizations

Visualization clutter: 
- Too much info/lines/data in the graph that muddles up the clarity

Main components of a graph:
1. Data: Axis/Axes and labels for them. 
2. Legend: Guide to help explain items on the graph.
3. Title: Label that is showing what's being plotted.

Three techniques to make data visualization more clear:

1. Maximize white space
2. Picking the correct graph
3. Similar graph grouping

How can color affect the way your visualizations are understood?:

- Contrasts can highlight changes in slope, or easily distinguish highly different items, especially with using 'close-colors'.
